# Data Visualization Project: Preliminary Storyboard

Data set: Military expenditure by country as a percentage of government spending in 2017

I wanted to work with this data set because SIPRI’s data visualization utilizes military spending in US dollars. Although these numbers are striking, I think that military spending as a percentage of government spending has the potential to show how much countries prioritize military expenditures over expenditures in other areas. As expected, visualizing military spending as a percentage of government spending has a different effect than visualizing military spending in raw US dollars. The latter draws attention to the US and China while the former draws attention to Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Belarus, and Oman. 

### Preliminary Storyboard:

Interaction: Rollover countries to see name and military expenditure as a percentage of government spending in 2017

I think that this interactive and color-coded world map will draw attention to the countries that are the darkest and cause users to wonder why.

→ 4 case studies on countries that spend the highest percentages of their budgets on military expenditures (potentially with traditional pie charts of government expenditures in general, bar graphs with the increase in military expenditures over time, or facts that could explain why spending on the military is high relative to other areas):

1) Sudan (30.9%)

4) Belarus (25.3%)

There seems to be the least amount of information on Belarus so I’m not sure if I will include this fourth case study or not.
